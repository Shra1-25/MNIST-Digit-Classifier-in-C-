# MNIST-Digit-Classifier-in-CPP  
Before compiling and executing main.cc, please make sure that the tf_1_graph.pb files and the csv files from imgs_csv folder for which you wish to run the inference are in the same folder and change the path of input files in the main.cc file accordingly.  
Note: Currently the code reads the 2D Grayscale images as csv, so the csv files of corresponding images in imgs folder are created in imgs_csv folder. (input_data0.csv file corresponds to test0.png image file, input_data1.csv file correspondsto test1.png file and so on)
